# Who-survived-the-Titanic

In the 'Who survived the Titanic?' project, we employ machine learning methods to construct a predictive model aimed at evaluating the chances of passengers surviving the tragic sinking of the Titanic. This comprehensive project involves various stages, including initial data exploration, preprocessing, and the development of predictive models. The models' performance is assessed through cross-validation, ensuring their reliability and accuracy. This multifaceted project combines data analysis and machine learning to explore the historical disaster's survival dynamics
